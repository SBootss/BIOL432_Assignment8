# ANALYSIS

how the communities of plants differ across sample locations (versus tutorial, how communities of bacteria are associated w/ plant samples) 

dataset: results of a floristic survey at the Queenâ€™s University Biological Station (QUBS).

QUESTIONS:

What effect (if any) does garlic mustard have on the plant community?

What has a stronger effect on plant communities: the presence/absence of garlic mustard (in/out) or sampling population?

Use at least one visualization for each question above and explain your reasoning.
